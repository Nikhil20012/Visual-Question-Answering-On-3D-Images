# Visual Question Answering on 3D Images

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) by incorporating 3D images. Unlike traditional VQA systems that work with 2D images, our approach uses multiple views of an environment to provide a richer understanding of the scene.

## Problem Statement

In standard VQA systems, a fixed 2D image often limits the agent's understanding of an environment. By using 3D images—where each scene consists of four different views—we aim to:

- Provide a more complete and detailed representation of objects and their positions.
- Improve the agent's ability to perceive and answer questions about the environment accurately.

## Goals

- **Enhanced Perception**: Use 3D images to reveal more information about object placements and relationships.
- **Advanced VQA**: Improve VQA capabilities by moving beyond the limitations of 2D images.
- **Robotics Applications**: Apply these advancements to improve human-robot interactions and real-world robotic systems.
